# Instances-for-Resilient-Distribution-Network-Design-under-Stochastic-Facility-Interdiction-
You can find the data used for the paper "Resilient Distribution Network Design under Stochastic Facility Interdiction" in this repository. 

In each data set, the four rows indicate the number of facilities (J), the number of customers (K), the number of suppliers (I), and the weight of the post-interdiction cost in the objective function. The next two rows indicate the demand of customers (dk) and the installation cost of facilities (fj). The next I rows indicate the transportation cost from supplier i to facilities (c’ij) and the next J rows indicate the transportation cost from facility j to customers (cjk). The last three rows indicate the capacity of suppliers (q’i), capacity of facilities (qj), and the interdiction budget (B).
